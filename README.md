# RN Playground

A react native project for me to play around with various libraries.

Each sub folder in [the features folder](https://github.com/Moistbobo/rn-playground/tree/develop/src/features/MobileStore) has its own readme on what the mini-app inside the folder contains.

The API_URL in the .env.sample was intentionally left there as some features require connection to my personal server.
