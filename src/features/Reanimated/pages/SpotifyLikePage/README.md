# SpotifyLikePage

A scrollview page that mimics the behavior of the album page on the spotify app.

Key behaviors:
- The main image scales smaller before it translates upwards and fades away
- The header fades in after the user has scrolled up to a threshold
- The Play (in this case the $ button) button scrolls with the list before stopping right on the end of the header
